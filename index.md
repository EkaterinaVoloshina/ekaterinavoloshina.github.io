## About me

Hej! My name is Ekaterina (Katya) Voloshina. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [CSE department](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/) of Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg advised by Krasimir Angelov and Aarne Ranta. My current research is connected to the [Abstract Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia) project and focused on neurosymbolic multinlingual applications. 

Previously, I worked on the interpretability of language models in connection to linguistic theories, including multimodal models.
